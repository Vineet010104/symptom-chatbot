AI-Driven Public Health Disease Awareness: Project Overview
1. Introduction
This document provides a detailed overview of an AI-driven public health application designed to raise disease awareness and provide preliminary diagnostic insights. The system leverages machine learning for disease classification, a conversational AI for a user-friendly voice interface, and a robust data management system to track and present diagnostic history.

2. Core Features and Functionality
2.1. Disease Classification and Insights
Symptom-Based Diagnosis: The system will use a Random Forest Classifier model to predict potential diseases based on user-provided symptoms.

Comprehensive Information: For each classified disease, the application will provide a detailed description, a list of precautionary measures, and the confidence level (accuracy) of the model's prediction.

2.2. Conversational Voice Assistant
Intuitive Interface: Powered by the Google Gemini API, the voice assistant will allow users to describe their symptoms naturally, making the process accessible and conversational.

Multilingual Support: The system will be capable of understanding and responding to users in multiple native languages, ensuring broad accessibility and inclusivity.

2.3. User Data and History Management
Personalized Dashboard: A personalized dashboard will be available for each user, providing a complete history of their past diagnoses.

Diagnosis History: The dashboard will maintain a log of symptoms entered, diseases classified, and the date of each interaction, offering a private health record.

2.4. Documentation and Reporting
PDF Generation: The application will enable users to generate and download a PDF report of their diagnosis details. This feature allows for easy sharing with healthcare professionals or for personal record-keeping.

3. Technology Stack
Frontend: Streamlit will be used to create an interactive and user-friendly web interface for the application. Its rapid development capabilities are ideal for building a dynamic dashboard and input forms.

Backend & Database: Python will serve as the backend language, with SQLite used as the lightweight database. SQLite will store user diagnosis history and other relevant data, providing a persistent and reliable storage solution.

Machine Learning: Key Python libraries, including NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for data manipulation, and Scikit-learn for model building, will be used to train and implement the Random Forest Classifier.

Conversational AI: The Google Gemini API will power the voice assistant, handling natural language processing (NLP) and speech-to-text/text-to-speech conversions for the multilingual system.

4. User Interaction Flow
User Onboarding: A user accesses the Streamlit application and is greeted by the voice assistant.

Symptom Input: The user describes their symptoms in their native language through the voice assistant.

Disease Classification: The spoken symptoms are processed, and the Random Forest model analyzes the input to predict a likely disease.

Information Display: The application displays the disease's name, a detailed description, a list of precautions, and the model's accuracy.

History & Reporting: The diagnosis details are saved to the user's dashboard in the SQLite database. From the dashboard, the user can review past diagnoses or generate a PDF report.

5. Data and Model
The Random Forest Classifier model will be trained on a dataset of symptoms and corresponding diseases. The model's accuracy will be a key metric, which will be displayed to the user as part of the diagnosis results.

6. Future Enhancements
Integration with Wearables: Incorporate data from wearables (e.g., smartwatches) to provide more accurate and personalized health insights.

Telemedicine Integration: Add the ability for users to connect directly with a healthcare professional after a diagnosis.

Real-time Public Health Alerts: Use the system to push real-time alerts about local disease outbreaks or public health advisories.
